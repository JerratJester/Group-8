Welcome to the project repository for Our Store!

Here you will find all of the artifacts, presentations, documentation, and source code for our SWE 3313 class project.
We will create a small e-commerce website using JavaFX and JSON to sell books.

Our website will allow users to browse our collection of books, add items to their cart, and checkout. We will also implement a search feature so that users can easily find the books they are looking for.
We are excited to share our progress with you, and we hope that you will enjoy using our website to purchase books.
