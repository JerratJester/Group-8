## Welcome to the project repository for Our Store!

Here you will find all of the artifacts, presentations, documentation, and source code for our SWE 3313 class project.

We will create a small e-commerce website using JavaFX and JSON to sell books.

Our website will allow users to:

* Browse our collection of books
* Add items to their cart
* Checkout
* Use a search feature to find the books they are looking for

We are excited to share our progress with you, and we hope that you will enjoy using our website to purchase books!

## Documentation

### Description For User
The Book Store Application allows users to search through the available inventory of books and purchase books. A new user can register on their own. Regular users who have an account with the application can log in and log out at will. Users who are logged in can search the inventory and add items to a shopping cart. Whenever the user would like to purchase, they can select from different shipping options and to buy of of the items in their cart.

### Replication
- Have IntelliJ (ultimate edition) installed 
- Have JavaFX Scene Builder installed
- Have a Windows Gluon Plugin
